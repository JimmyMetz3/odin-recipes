    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello world! This is my first project while following the odin project. I
      have recently began my programming journey in December of 2022. Please do
      not take these recipes seriously as my strengths are not in cooking. Thank
      you for taking a look at this!
    </p>
